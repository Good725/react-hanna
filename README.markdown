# Hanna -- a better RDoc template

Hanna is an RDoc template that scales. It's implemented in Haml, making it
clean and readable. It's built with simplicity, beauty and ease of browsing in
mind.

## A work in progress

Hanna is far from done, but it is the first RDoc template that's actually
_maintainable_.  First thing I have done is converted the original HTML
template to Haml and Sass, cleaning up and removing the (ridiculous amount of)
duplication.

Also, the template fragments are now in _separate files_. You would have
fainted if you seen how it was before. (It's really no wonder why there are no
other RDoc templates around ... save one: Allison.)
